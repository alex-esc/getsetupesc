- Setupesc :: Version released on September 25th 2018
	* A new beginning and going forward
		- Technical changes
			+ Keybinds v5 and the experimental features are combined into a new project called 'Setupesc'.
			+ Source code and executable made publicly available on github.
			+ Gnu general public license version 3 chosen as the license.
			+ Some (but not all) previous versions will be archived on the github repo.
		- Going forward & what to expect.
			+ New releases: from now on this project will receive regular updates and new versions to come will all be called setupesc, there will not be a version number, rather than referring to each version under a number the new versions will be refereed to by date of release.
			+ Philosophy of this project: The way we interface with computers has changed from pressing to swiping, from local to online & from unrestricted to centralized and this change is making an impact on productivity. These changes have been mostly for the better but there are a few exceptions, mainly the interface itself and therefore I try to maximize productivity by minimizing the graphical interface.
			+ Accessibility & ease of use: As this project evolves I will be also focusing on making this set of scripts a 'set it and forget it' type of program, as the name implies this is a setup program aimed to be used on a fresh windows install. In the future this program will allow you to batch install all the programs you need to get your windows up and running quickly and to mirror my personal computer setup aimed to increase productivity, later versions will have a GUI for configuring and changing all the settings of this script, to modify settings for now you have to dive in the source code.
			+ The best way to enjoy this project: Because this program is meant to imitate my computer setup I invite you to use it as it is, then if you run into any issues or want to add a feature/shortcut, make the changes necessary until you find a comfortable setup, then save your new version on a USB drive if you ever need to install it on a new computer and consider publishing the code online. The point is that just because it doesn't work out of the box exactly like you like it don't just give it up, give it a couple weeks and modify it until it fits you just right.
